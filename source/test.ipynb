      " it is valuable to remember that the power spectrum methods should be applied very carefully . \n",
      " the difficulties in the interpretation of significant peaks could be caused by at least four effects : a sampling of a continuos function , an echo - effect , a contribution of long - term periodicities and a random noise . \n",
      " first effect exists because periodicities , which are shorter than the sampling interval , may mix with longer periodicities . in result , this effect can be reduced by an decrease of the sampling interval between observations . \n",
      " the echo - effect occurs when there is a latent harmonic of frequency @xmath10 in the time series , giving a spectral peak at @xmath10 , and also periodic terms of frequency @xmath11 etc . \n",
      " this may be detected by the autocorrelation function for time series with a large variance . \n",
      " time series often contain long - term periodicities , that influence short - term peaks . \n",
      " they could rise periodogram s peaks at lower frequencies . \n",
      " however , it is also easy to notice the influence of the long - term periodicities on short - term peaks in the graphs of the autocorrelation functions . \n",
      " this effect is observed for the time series of solar activity indexes which are limited by the 11-year cycle .    to find statistically significant periodicities \n",
      " it is reasonable to use the autocorrelation function and the power spectrum method with a high resolution . in the case of a stationary time \n",
